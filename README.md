# Sorting
In this project, I compared the time performance of the Bubble,
Insertion, and Quick-sort sorting algorithms. As well as Python's built-in
`sort()` function (which is called "Tim-sort"). This CSV file can be opened with MS Execl, OpenOffice, Google Sheets, etc. to
create a line graph where the x-axis represents the list size
and the y-axis indicates average execution time in seconds. For each algorithm, there should be
6 datapoints: where the list size is 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000. Each list's
values should range from 1 to the list's length (`random.randint(0, n)`).
To improve accuracy, each datapoint should be the average of 10 executions on
different lists.
